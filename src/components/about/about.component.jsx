          My name is Pranav Mitra, I'm a Front End Engineer based in Delhi,
          India. Currently pursuing my B.Ttech. degree majoring in Electronics.
          I wish to further my career as a web developer building beautiful and
          intuitive websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience with React and Context API as well as proficiency in
          Javascript, HTML and CSS which I have used to build an array of
          websites. I have strong problem solving skills with knowledge of C++
          that helps me make use of various data structues and algorithms to
          solve real life based problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time you would find me in front of a chess board or a ping
          pong table.
